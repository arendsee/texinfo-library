#texinfo corpus

I love me my info. Why read on a browser or anywhere else when the blissfull
gloom of a tex info page is available? This repository is a, or rather will by,
a collection of freely available books, manuals, anthologies and such all
formatted as texinfo documents. Also present here, will be an scripts I develop
for easing translations.
